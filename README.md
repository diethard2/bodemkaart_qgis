BODEMKAART QGIS

The bodemkaart_qgis project is a project to convert the freely avaible cryptic soil map of the Netherlands into a very informative map in QGIS.

Purpose is to produce a manual in PDF format that explains step by step how to do this. I will ofcourse also include an open office document that is used to create the PDF file and all images.

This manual will also refer to csv files that will also be provided on this site and that need regular updates. The soil map includes many cryptic codes like "aEVc" which actually means "Boveengronden op zeggeveen, rietzeggeveen of broekveen (al dan niet op zand, beginnend ondieper dan 120 cm)". Yep, it is Dutch and actually even the Dutch will have to browse further on the internet to understand what this means.

First the soil map is decrypted (adding readable text) and than I will provide additional functionality for QGIS to make the information available to the user in a sensible way!
